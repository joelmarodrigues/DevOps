# DevOps Assignment
## ***Description***

This is a simple application that allows users to create, read, update and delete event. The application is built using React, Node, Express, FullCalendar and MySQL.
## ***Installation***

To run the application, you need to have Node.js and MySQL installed on your machine.

To fully run the application, you need to run both the server and the client.

The server is located in the `server` folder and the client is located in the `client` folder.

The server is configured to run the MySQL from the server and locally. If you want to use your own database, you need to change the database configuration in the `server/config/database.js` file.

***
### ***Running the Server***

Open a terminal and run the following commands:
1. `cd server`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

***
### ***Running the Client***

Open a terminal and run the following commands:
1. `cd client`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

***
### ***Building the Application***

Open a terminal and run the following commands:
1. `cd client`
2.  `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
